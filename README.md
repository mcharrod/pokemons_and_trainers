# README

This is a practice project for learning the basics of a one-to-many relationship for a Ruby on Rails app. All versions of the gems I'm using are stored in Gemfile.lock

Alongside the gems that are added by default for rails apps, I will also be using:

- Capybara
- RSpec-rails
- Pry
- Shoulda-matchers
- Orderly 

You will need to run a bundle install after cloning down this repository for the app to run as expected.
