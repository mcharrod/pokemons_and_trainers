# README

This is a practice project for learning the basics of a one-to-many relationship for a Ruby on Rails project. All versions of the gems I'm using are stored in Gemfile.lock

Alongside the gems that are added by default for rails projects, I will be using 
- Capybara 
- RSpec-rails
- Pry 
- Shoulda-matchers

You will need to run a bundle install after cloning down this repo to run it.
